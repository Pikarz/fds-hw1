# Image Filtering and Object Identification - Homework #1

# Overview

This group project is the first homework in Image Processing, covering fundamental techniques in image filtering, edge detection, object identification, and performance evaluation. We implemented several algorithms, analyzed results, and documented observations in a Jupyter Notebook.


**Outline**

    Image Filtering: Applying 1D and 2D filters for image enhancement.
    Edge Detection: Using operators like Prewitt and Canny, and exploring multi-scale representations.
    Object Identification: Color histograms, retrieval methods, and metrics.
    Performance Evaluation: Assessing retrieval accuracy and analyzing results.
